		<p>In the forest stands the woman, a half-remembered half-forgotten being. She smiles at you, and everything--</p>

		<p class = "big">s-t-o-p-s</p>

		<p class = "dialogue">You've come. I'm so glad to see you.</p>

		<p>She seems to know you, somehow.</p>

		<p class = "dialogue">You'll forget about me as soon as you leave...but I was glad to see you. You being here is the <span>highlight</span> of my current existence.</p>

		<p>You try to speak, but all your words seem to lodge in your mouth. A force, inexplicable, begins to drag you away. As you get farther and farther away from the woman, you realize you can say one single thing...</p>

		<p>Do you say:</p>

		<p><a href = "highlight.html">You were the <span>highlight</span>too.</a></p>

		<p><a href = "end.html">No...I'll remember! I'll always remember!</a></p>
